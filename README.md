# AutoTravis
Work tool used for pulling nessus results from a MySQL database and adding them to a formatted report

## Usage

Just run Auto-Travis.py

## Requirements

Another tool is required to export nessus vulnerability results to a MySQL database (tool will be added at a later date), however once added, this script usually finishes in seconds.

## But why?

Our boss would get constantly changing requirements from the client, which would force us to spend hours re-analyzing the data and re-formatting. This makes it possible in seconds
